# ElizaBot
A discord bot with fun features made for my own amusement

## Features

### Commands:
#### .flipcoin
literally just says heads or tails

#### .prequel
posts a meme from /r/prequelmemes

### Message responses:

#### No swearing!
bot will respond with a gif of the very nice and very evil Danhausen of AEW informing the user to not swear! The bot is a little sensitive right now,
I aim to fix that in time :)

#### Emoji Echo
If the user does not swear and their message contains all unique letters, the bot will react to the message with the user's message spelt out in emoji letters.
This idea is what sparked off my quest into making a Discord bot. And now here we are, scolding everyone for swearing and posting prequel memes all day.
